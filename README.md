# neutral_Hacienda

This Mod bypasses some hardcoded parts of Anno1800 to redesign the UI of the Hacienda and make it possible to use copies of the Hacienda in other sessions of the game without it looking out of place.

Just drop the extracted file in your /mods folder
You are now able to create a Hacienda clone with a clean and neutral Interface.

Please don't alter the files if you are using it to create your own mod. It should be the same for everyone to prevent compatibility issues. If you find any issues or have some ideas to further inprove the project, just contact me.


Big Thanks to Taludas who helped me along the way. His Mod Wholesome Hacienda Haul is not compatible with this one at the moment!
Have Fun!
